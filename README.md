- Creating a README file for your game on GitHub is a great way to provide information to users, developers, or anyone interested in your project. Here's a simple template for a game README:

```markdown
# Game Name

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

Briefly describe your game, its main features, and any unique aspects that make it stand out.

## Screenshots

Include screenshots or gifs showcasing different aspects of your game.

## Table of Contents

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Controls](#controls)
- [Features](#features)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

Provide instructions on how to install and run your game. Include dependencies, if any.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-gamerepo.git
cd your-gamerepo
npm install  # or any other installation command
```

## Usage

Explain how to play or interact with your game. Include any prerequisites or setup needed.

```bash
npm start  # or any other command to run the game
```

## Controls

List the controls for your game. Include keyboard, mouse, or any other input devices.

- Move: Arrow keys or WASD
- Jump: Spacebar

## Features

Highlight the key features of your game. What makes it interesting or unique?

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- ...

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to the project, provide guidelines for others who may be interested in helping out.

1. Fork the project
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/add-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/add-new-feature`)
5. Open a pull request

## License

Creating a full 100-stage game involves a considerable amount of code, and it may not be practical to provide the entire code here. However, I can give you a basic structure and an idea of how to implement a game with multiple stages.

```python
import pygame
import sys
import random

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Constants
WIDTH, HEIGHT = 800, 600
BALL_RADIUS = 20
BALL_COLOR = (255, 0, 0)
PLATFORM_COLOR = (0, 0, 255)
BACKGROUND_COLOR = (255, 255, 255)
GRAVITY = 1
JUMP_FORCE = 15
PLATFORM_HEIGHT = 20
PLATFORM_SPEED = 5
PLATFORM_WIDTH = 100
SCORE_FONT = pygame.font.Font(None, 36)
MAX_STAGES = 100

# Create the screen
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption("Jumping Ball Game")

# Create the ball
ball = pygame.Rect(WIDTH // 2 - BALL_RADIUS, HEIGHT // 2 - BALL_RADIUS, BALL_RADIUS * 2, BALL_RADIUS * 2)
ball_speed_y = 0

# Create the platform
platform = pygame.Rect(WIDTH, HEIGHT - PLATFORM_HEIGHT, PLATFORM_WIDTH, PLATFORM_HEIGHT)

# Initialize score and stage
score = 0
current_stage = 1

# Main game loop
while current_stage <= MAX_STAGES:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()

        # Jump when the spacebar is pressed
        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN and event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:
            if ball.bottom == HEIGHT:
                ball_speed_y = -JUMP_FORCE

    # Apply gravity
    ball_speed_y += GRAVITY
    ball.y += ball_speed_y

    # Move the platform
    platform.left -= PLATFORM_SPEED

    # Reset platform when it goes off the screen
    if platform.right < 0:
        platform.left = WIDTH
        platform.top = random.randint(HEIGHT // 2, HEIGHT - PLATFORM_HEIGHT)

    # Check for collisions with the platform
    if ball.colliderect(platform):
        ball.bottom = platform.top
        ball_speed_y = 0
        score += 1

    # Keep the ball within the screen
    if ball.top > HEIGHT:
        ball.top = HEIGHT
        ball_speed_y = 0

    # Bounce off the walls
    if ball.left < 0 or ball.right > WIDTH:
        ball_speed_y = 0

    # Fill the background
    screen.fill(BACKGROUND_COLOR)

    # Draw the ball
    pygame.draw.circle(screen, BALL_COLOR, ball.center, BALL_RADIUS)

    # Draw the platform
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, PLATFORM_COLOR, platform)

    # Display the score and stage
    score_text = SCORE_FONT.render(f"Stage: {current_stage}/{MAX_STAGES}   Score: {score}", True, (0, 0, 0))
    screen.blit(score_text, (10, 10))

    # Update the display
    pygame.display.flip()

    # Cap the frame rate
    pygame.time.Clock().tick(60)

    # Move to the next stage if the ball reaches the top
    if ball.top <= 0:
        current_stage += 1
        ball.y = HEIGHT - BALL_RADIUS  # Reset ball position
        ball_speed_y = 0  # Reset ball speed
```
